# mnsongngan - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Song Ngan! I have an analytical background in Finance and currently, I am looking for an oppotunity as a Data Analytics. I have developed a strong foundation in researching and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics
